description: "A social riff on IMDB. It's a fully fledged movie & TV reference app from which you can form a friends group and create a shared reviews database. 

Users are able to comment on and discuss reviews, upvote them, trade poo and aubergine emojis... users received notifications when friends submit ratings or comment on active discussions. User of this app will have a constant feed of cool things to watch with no need to gamble on the increasingly dreadful output of the streaming services. 

The app tells the user on what streaming services movies are playing. It also shows the user how old actors were at the time they were filming their roles which simply makes it more fun than IMDB. "
